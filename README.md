Used to demonstrate simple Harbour programs, to compile and run in MS Windows or Linux (tested in Ubuntu).

Each sample program is located in its own folder and has two related .code-workspace VSCODE workspace file, one when building under MS Windows, the other one under Linux.   
The files in the BuildTools folder of this repo are used by all samples.
