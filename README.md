# Harbour_Samples
Used to demonstrate simple Harbour programs

Each sample program is located in its own folder and has a related .code-workspace VSCODE workspace file.
The files in the root folder of this repo are used by all samples.

Please update the file vscode_debugger.prg using the VSCODE "Harbour: Get debugger code" command.
